This is a simple web application that utilizes React, Skeleton-Framework, and Firebase. These tools work in tandem to allow users to create and store events in the cloud.

## Main Features
- Support for registration and logging in
- Form that allows users to create a new event
- Event view that gets all events created by that user
- Saved login state using cookies allowing for quick access on return
